# Changepoint_Outlook

### Installation/Requirements
1. Python 3
2. pywin32
3. selenium
4. selenium chrome webdriver
5. Outlook

### Description
**You have to have Training and Production Project pinned to the time sheet to work**

Looks in my Outlook calendar and grabs all my training hours for the past 4 days + the current day, and puts those times into the Changepoint time sheet training hours then calculates the remaining hours and puts that in the production hours.

I use this with **Windows Task Scheduler**, and I have it run every Friday, so it would grab times from Monday-Friday.
